Description: Program for adjusting soundcard volumes.
 Umix is a program for adjusting soundcard volumes and other
 features in soundcard mixers. You can control your volumes, balances and
 recording sources flexibly from the command line, with a ncurses
 user interface with familiar vi/emacs keybindings or with a GTK+2 graphical
 UI. Umix supports multiple mixer devices  and all mixer drivers and UI's are
 dynamically loaded at runtime as plugins. All settings can be saved and loaded
 from a file.
