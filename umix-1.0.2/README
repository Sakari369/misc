1 What is Umix ?

Umix is an advanced program for adjusting soundcard mixers
in Linux and other Unices. You can control your volumes,
balances and recording sources flexibly from the command
line, or with a fullscreen user interface. Umix currently
supports only Linux and OSS, but support for other unices
and mixer drivers should be easy to implement, because it
is designed with modularity in mind. All mixer drivers and
UIs are loaded dynamically at runtime. I designed it as
an replacement for AUmix.

1.1 How to use Umix ?

Read the man-page.

1.2 What does Umix mean ?

Nothing particular. Ultimate Mixer ? Unix Mixer ? Something
like that. Yes, I know it's a dull name.

1.3 Why another volume mixer ?

I got frustrated with Aumix, and there were no other good
alternatives that had terminal/ncurses user interfaces.
I myself like to do all my work in a console, and at the
same time I usually listen to mp3/nsf music, and need to
adjust my soundcard volumes constantly. Aumix acts weird,
eats too much CPU cycles etc. If you want to modify it in
any sensible way, total rewrite would be the only way.
