Version 1.0.2
=============
Fixed a bug that might have caused segfaulting when quitting, and fixed a bug
that was introduced in 1.0.1 that caused the ncurses UI to display incorrect
values when loading or saving settings.

Version 1.0.1
=============
Minor bugfixes and updates. Updated Debian packages to build with correct
version number. You know what they say about final releases..

Version 1.0
============
Final version released. Removed plugin code, and unnecessary UIs. This is just
a simplified commandline and ncurses UI release, as I originally intended. 
I'm not working on Umix anymore, and this was a test project to begin with.

Version 0.9.3
=============
Umix has moved to SourceForge.Net! The new homepage URL is 
http://umix.sf.net/, check it out now! You can now also access the CVS tree
via anonymous access. Wow, CVS is the best thing since hmm .. RCS :) !

Version 0.9.2
=============
Minor bugfixes and tweaking. Default device with Linux is now /dev/sound/mixer,
you can use `configure --with-mixer-dev=path' to configure it.

Version 0.9.1
=============
GTK+2 user interface is now built by default. Note that the GTK+2 UI is still 
far from ready, but it is somehow usable by now. More verbose plugin handling 
and of course bugfixes and general polish.

Version 0.9.0
=============
Now includes an experimental GTK+2 user interface! See ChangeLog for details. 
Rewrote the API again, better plugin handling and general code cleanup.

Version 0.8.3
=============
Minor changes to error reporting and plugins are now built independently.

Version 0.8.2
=============
Added support for sliding volumes in steps and fixed some bugs. Now with
Slackware packages too.

Version 0.8.1
=============
Code and documentation were polished, and some bugfixes were added.

Version 0.8.0
=============
Major rewrite of almost everything, now uses a function based API to access 
mixer interfaces. New dynamic way of parsing channel options: channels are no 
longer parsed as commandline options but as channel names. Renamed some 
commandline options and of course bugfixes.

Version 0.7.2
=============
This release includes a new command line option for printing current global 
settings, a new option to enter volumes manually in ui_ncurses, fixes for 
command line options -p, -s, and --ui to actually work, and some other minor 
bugfixes.

Version 0.7.1
=============
A new way of scaling stuff in the ncurses UI, a bugfix in loading settings, 
removal of the GTK UI, a new third mixer device in the dummy driver, and some 
code cleanups.

Version 0.7.0
=============
All optional drivers and UIs are now dynamically loaded at runtime. 
Configuration file format rewritten so that global options and multiple mixer 
settings can be saved and loaded.

Version 0.6.0
=============
A rewrite for the whole mixer interface, including support for multiple mixer i
devices in one session, maybe even with different drivers.

Version 0.5
=============
Better error handling and various updates.

Version 0.4
=============
Internationalization support and some small fixes.

Version 0.3
=============
Initial public announcement.
